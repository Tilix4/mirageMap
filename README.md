Portability
-----------
In order to remain as portable as possible, miragemap has been based on web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS).
To use it, download the folder with the green button above, and extract the archive. Open miragemap.html by double clicking or opening it in a web browser.
You must always move the folder, miragemap.html doesn't work alone.

It runs perfectly with Firefox and Chrome.
Of course, issues may happen with Internet Explorer or Edge.
Not tested with Safari or any other web browser.

Use Case
--------
Mirage Map becomes really useful when at least two Video-Projectors are used.
It provides regular shapes generation which makes volume deformations and softedges more visible (Grid, Circles, Crosses).
Grid Numbers and Gradient prevent confusion of which slice of the input stream you're mapping.
Name your maps for recognizing them with a quick look.

You can download the full map or each layers if you want to modify them in your favourite image processing editor.
